# Intelligent Document Processing System

### Introduction
In this project, we will develop an intelligent document processing system that can extract relevant information from scanned documents, classify them based on their content, and provide insights using Azure AI and Machine Learning services. The system will leverage Azure Cognitive Services for optical character recognition (OCR), natural language processing (NLP), and computer vision tasks, as well as Azure Machine Learning for model training, deployment, and operationalization.

### Prerequisites
Before starting this project, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed:
* Python 3.7 or higher
* Azure Subscription
* Azure Machine Learning Workspace
* Azure Cognitive Services (Computer Vision, Text Analytics, Form Recognizer)
* Azure Blob Storage
* Azure Databricks (optional)

### Step 1: Set up Azure Resources
First, we need to set up the required Azure resources, including an Azure Machine Learning Workspace, Cognitive Services resources (Computer Vision, Text Analytics, Form Recognizer), and an Azure Blob Storage account.
