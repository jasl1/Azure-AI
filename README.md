# Intelligent Document Processing System

### Introduction
In this project, we will develop an intelligent document processing system that can extract relevant information from scanned documents, classify them based on their content, and provide insights using Azure AI and Machine Learning services. The system will leverage Azure Cognitive Services for optical character recognition (OCR), natural language processing (NLP), and computer vision tasks, as well as Azure Machine Learning for model training, deployment, and operationalization.

### Prerequisites
Before starting this project, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed:
* Python 3.7 or higher
* Azure Subscription
* Azure Machine Learning Workspace
* Azure Cognitive Services (Computer Vision, Text Analytics, Form Recognizer)
* Azure Blob Storage
* Azure Databricks (optional)

### Step 1: Set up Azure Resources
First, we need to set up the required Azure resources, including an Azure Machine Learning Workspace, Cognitive Services resources (Computer Vision, Text Analytics, Form Recognizer), and an Azure Blob Storage account.

```python
from azure.ai.ml import MLClient
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential

# Set up Azure Machine Learning Workspace
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
ml_client = MLClient(credential, subscription_id, resource_group, workspace_name)

# Set up Cognitive Services resources
from azure.ai.formrecognizer import FormRecognizerClient
from azure.ai.textanalytics import TextAnalyticsClient
from azure.cognitiveservices.vision.computervision import ComputerVisionClient

form_recognizer_client = FormRecognizerClient(endpoint, credential)
text_analytics_client = TextAnalyticsClient(endpoint, credential)
computer_vision_client = ComputerVisionClient(endpoint, credential)

```

### Step 2: Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
We'll use the Azure Computer Vision service to perform OCR on scanned documents and extract text.

```python
from azure.cognitiveservices.vision.computervision import ComputerVisionClient
from azure.cognitiveservices.vision.computervision.models import OperationStatusCodes
from azure.core.exceptions import ResourceNotFoundError
import time

def ocr_document(image_url):
    read_results = []
    operation_location = None

    # Call the Computer Vision API to perform OCR
    read_results = computer_vision_client.read(image_url, raw=True)

    # Get the operation location and wait for the operation to complete
    operation_location = read_results.headers["Operation-Location"]
    operation_id = operation_location.split("/")[-1]

    while True:
        read_result = computer_vision_client.get_read_result(operation_id)
        if read_result.status not in [OperationStatusCodes.running]:
            break
        time.sleep(1)

    # Get the text from the OCR results
    if read_result.status == OperationStatusCodes.succeeded:
        for text_result in read_result.analyze_result.read_results:
            for line in text_result.lines:
                read_results.append(line.text)

    return "\n".join(read_results)

```

### Step 3: Natural Language Processing (NLP)
We'll use the Azure Text Analytics service to perform NLP tasks, such as entity extraction, key phrase extraction, and sentiment analysis, on the extracted text.

```python
def analyze_text(text):
    entities = []
    key_phrases = []
    sentiment = None

    # Call the Text Analytics API for entity extraction
    entities_result = text_analytics_client.recognize_entities(text)[0]
    for entity in entities_result.entities:
        entities.append((entity.text, entity.category))

    # Call the Text Analytics API for key phrase extraction
    key_phrases_result = text_analytics_client.extract_key_phrases(text)[0]
    key_phrases = key_phrases_result.key_phrases

    # Call the Text Analytics API for sentiment analysis
    sentiment_result = text_analytics_client.analyze_sentiment(text)[0]
    sentiment = sentiment_result.sentiment

    return entities, key_phrases, sentiment

```

### Step 4: Document Classification
We'll train a machine learning model using Azure Machine Learning to classify documents based on their content. We can use techniques like transfer learning with pre-trained language models (e.g., BERT) or fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 using Azure OpenAI Service.

```python
from azure.ai.ml import MLClient, Input, Output
from azure.ai.ml.entities import Data, Environment, CodeConfiguration
from azure.ai.ml.constants import AssetTypes

# Set up data and environment
data = Data(
    path="data/",
    type=AssetTypes.URI_FOLDER,
    description="Document classification dataset",
)

env = Environment(
    name="doc-classification-env",
    conda_file="conda.yml",
    image="mcr.microsoft.com/azureml/openmpi3.1.2-ubuntu18.04",
)

# Set up code configuration
code = CodeConfiguration(
    code="src/",
    scoring_script="score.py",
)

# Create a job to train the model
job = ml_client.jobs.create_or_update(
    "doc-classification-job",
    inputs=dict(data=data.as_input()),
    code=code,
    environment=env,
)

# Wait for the job to complete
ml_client.jobs.stream(job.name)

# Register the trained model
model = ml_client.models.create_or_update(
    "doc-classification-model",
    path=job.outputs.model_output,
    type=AssetTypes.MLFLOW_MODEL,
)

```

### Step 5: Model Deployment and Operationalization
Finally, we'll deploy the trained model as a web service using Azure Machine Learning and integrate it with the OCR, NLP, and document classification components to create the intelligent document processing system.

```python
from azure.ai.ml.entities import ManagedOnlineEndpoint, ManagedOnlineDeployment

# Create an online endpoint
endpoint = ManagedOnlineEndpoint(
    name="doc-processing-endpoint",
    auth_mode="key",
)
ml_client.online_endpoints.begin_create_or_update(endpoint).wait()

# Deploy the model to the online endpoint
deployment = ManagedOnlineDeployment(
    name="doc-classification",
    endpoint_name=endpoint.name,
    model=model.id,
    instance_type="Standard_DS3_v2",
    instance_count=1,
)
ml_client.online_deployments.begin_create_or_update(deployment).wait()

# Get the scoring URL
scoring_url = ml_client.online_endpoints.get(
    name=endpoint.name
).scoring_uri

# Use the deployed model for inference
import requests

def classify_document(image_url):
    text = ocr_document(image_url)
    entities, key_phrases, sentiment = analyze_text(text)
    data = {"text": text, "entities": entities, "key_phrases": key_phrases, "sentiment": sentiment}
    response = requests.post(scoring_url, json=data)
    prediction = response.json()
    return prediction

```

This example demonstrates how to build an intelligent document processing system using various Azure AI and Machine Learning services, including Azure Cognitive Services (Computer Vision, Text Analytics), Azure Machine Learning, and Azure OpenAI Service (for fine-tuning LLMs). It covers the key steps of setting up Azure resources, performing OCR and NLP tasks, training a document classification model, deploying the model as a web service, and integrating all components into a unified system.
